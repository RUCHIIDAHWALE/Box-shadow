            Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness.
            Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision
            and night vision are much better than that of humans.

            Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; 
            four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six
            times their length.
